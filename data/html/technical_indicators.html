<h1>Technical Indicators</h1>
<p>Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on price, volume,
or open interest data. They help traders identify trends and potential reversals.</p>

<h2>Moving Averages</h2>
<p>The Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) smooth
out price data to reveal the underlying trend direction.</p>

<h2>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</h2>
<p>RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of price
changes. Values above 70 suggest overbought conditions; below 30 suggest oversold.</p>

<h2>MACD</h2>
<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator shows the relationship
between two moving averages. A MACD crossover can signal a trend change.</p>

<h2>Bollinger Bands</h2>
<p>Bollinger Bands consist of a middle SMA band and two standard-deviation bands.
Price touching the outer bands can indicate overbought or oversold conditions.</p>
