<h1>Risk Management in Trading</h1>
<p>Effective risk management is the single most important factor that separates
successful traders from unsuccessful ones.</p>

<h2>Position Sizing</h2>
<p>Never risk more than 1-2% of your total account balance on a single trade.
This ensures that a series of losses does not wipe out your capital.</p>

<h2>Stop-Loss Orders</h2>
<p>A stop-loss order automatically closes a position when the price moves against
you by a specified amount. It limits downside risk on every trade.</p>

<h3>Trailing Stop</h3>
<p>A trailing stop adjusts automatically as the price moves in your favour,
locking in profits while still providing downside protection.</p>

<h2>Risk-Reward Ratio</h2>
<p>Aim for a minimum risk-reward ratio of 1:2. This means your potential profit
should be at least twice your potential loss on each trade.</p>
