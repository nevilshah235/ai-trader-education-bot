# Trade Explanation

Great job on this winning CALL option trade on R_100! You correctly predicted that the price would increase over the 5-minute duration. You bought the option at 250.50, and the price rose to 251.00 by the exit time. Because the exit price was higher than your entry price, the CALL option paid out, resulting in a profit for you. This demonstrates a good understanding of directional movement within a short timeframe.
