# Trade Explanation

Great job on this Volatility 100 Index trade! You correctly predicted an upward price movement within the 5-minute timeframe using a CALL option. Your entry point was 250.50, and the price rose to 251.00 by the expiry, securing you a profit. What's particularly interesting is that this was your third trade in a sequence, following a win and a loss. This highlights the importance of not letting previous outcomes overly influence your current decisions, and focusing on the specific conditions of each trade. 

By choosing a fixed expiry time, you relied solely on the price movement to go your way. This can be a straightforward approach, but it's also higher risk because you have no control over the trade once it's placed. As you gain more experience, you might explore strategies that incorporate stop-loss or take-profit levels to manage risk more actively. Keep up the great work, and remember that each trade is a valuable learning opportunity!

## Learning Points
1. Successful prediction of upward price movement using a CALL option.
2. Importance of independent analysis for each trade, regardless of previous outcomes.
3. Fixed expiry times require accurate price movement predictions; consider risk management tools in the future (stop loss).
