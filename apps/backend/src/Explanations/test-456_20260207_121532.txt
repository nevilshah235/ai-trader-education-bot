# Trade Explanation

Okay, let's break down what happened with this PUT option trade. You bought the option expecting the asset's price to decrease, but it actually increased from 100.25 to 100.50 during the one-minute contract. Because you had a PUT option, which profits when the underlying asset goes *down*, this upward movement resulted in a loss. It's a good example of how even a small price change in the 'wrong' direction can impact a short-term options trade.

The key takeaway here is the importance of accurately predicting the price movement within the contract's timeframe. One-minute contracts are fast-paced, and even minor volatility can make or break the trade. This trade underscores the risk associated with short-term options, where timing and direction are extremely critical. Don't be discouraged by this loss; view it as a learning opportunity to refine your understanding of market dynamics and improve your timing.

## Learning Points
1. Price direction is crucial for PUT option trades: the asset price must decrease for the option to be profitable.
2. Short-term options (like 1-minute contracts) are highly sensitive to small price fluctuations.
3. Analyze why the asset price moved against your prediction to improve future trade decisions.
