# Trade Explanation

Okay, let's break down what happened with this PUT option trade. You bought the PUT expecting the price to go *down* within one minute, but it actually went *up*. Since you were betting against the price increase, your option expired out-of-the-money, resulting in a $5 loss. This highlights the risk in short-term options trading: even a small price fluctuation in the 'wrong' direction can lead to a loss. Remember, predicting short-term price movements is tough, and timing is crucial.

## Learning Points
1. Short timeframes (like 1 minute) are very sensitive to small price movements, increasing risk.
2. Accurate price direction prediction is crucial for options trading, especially with PUT or CALL options.
3. Review the factors that influenced your prediction. Were there any news events or indicators you might have missed that signaled a potential price increase?
