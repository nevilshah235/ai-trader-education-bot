# Trade Explanation

Okay, let's break down this one-minute PUT option trade. You bought a PUT, meaning you predicted the price would go *down* from your entry point of 100.25. Since the price actually went *up* to 100.50 by the time the option expired, the trade resulted in a loss. One-minute options are super fast-paced, and even a small price change against your prediction can lead to a loss, as we saw here. Don't get discouraged—every trade is a learning opportunity!

## Learning Points
1. PUT options profit when the asset's price decreases below the entry price before expiry.
2. Very short expiry times, like one minute, are highly sensitive to small price fluctuations.
3. Carefully consider the risk-reward of short-term options, as small movements can lead to quick losses.
